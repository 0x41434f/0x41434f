## Hi there 👋

I am a software engineer and mental health worker with a strong interest in **Computational Psychiatry** and **Health Policy**.

- 🔭 I'm currently finishing my medical school prerequisites with the goal of becoming a **Consultation-Liaison Psychiatrist**.
- 🌱 I want to learn more about how psychiatry, mental health science, and healthcare policies shape patient care.
- 💡 My plan is to use my background (BS in Computer Science with a Cybersecurity focus, plus 7+ years as an engineer and venture capital analyst) to help make sense of clinical data and improve behavioral healthcare.
- 💬 Feel free to ask me about my time as a **Mental Health Worker** or my thoughts on mental health policy.
